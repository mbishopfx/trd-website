================================================================================
2. @GRAPH SCHEMA IMPLEMENTATION
================================================================================

2.1 WHAT IS @GRAPH?
-------------------
@graph is an advanced JSON-LD structure that bundles multiple related schema 
entities into a single comprehensive entity graph. Instead of isolated schema 
blocks, @graph creates interconnected entity maps that search engines use to 
build Knowledge Graphs.

TRADITIONAL APPROACH (Before):
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "WebPage",
  "name": "Page Title"
}

@GRAPH APPROACH (After):
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@graph": [
    {
      "@type": "Organization",
      "@id": "https://truerankdigital.com/#organization",
      "name": "True Rank Digital"
    },
    {
      "@type": "WebSite",
      "@id": "https://truerankdigital.com/#website",
      "publisher": { "@id": "https://truerankdigital.com/#organization" }
    },
    {
      "@type": "WebPage",
      "@id": "https://truerankdigital.com/page#webpage",
      "isPartOf": { "@id": "https://truerankdigital.com/#website" }
    }
  ]
}

BENEFITS:
✓ Single @context declaration (cleaner, faster parsing)
✓ Clear entity relationships via @id linking
✓ Better Knowledge Graph connectivity
✓ Enhanced AI comprehension
✓ Higher rich results eligibility

  "@graph": [
    {
      "@type": "FAQPage",
      "@id": "https://truerankdigital.com/page#faqpage",

      ]
    },
